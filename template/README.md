Photoshop source files provided as is. It was organized only enough for my own sanity so I apologize in advance for it not being as clear and documented as it should be. Bezel text was recreated whenever possible with the closest fonts that I could find. LEDs and other graphics were created from scratch as much as possible for fidelity (and personal taste purposes). Separate files were created for different system aspect ratios. Thanks to Jeltron for the original layouts that were used as the dimensions for overlays.
