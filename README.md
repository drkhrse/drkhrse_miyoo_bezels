# drkhrse Miyoo Bezels
My 4:3 bezels for Retroarch, originally created for Onion OS on the Miyoo Mini+. This set covers the Game Boy (DMG, Pocket, and Color) and Game Boy Advanced. My intention was to create overlays that are darker than most of the defaults and also have more full screen options with the Game Boy default aspect ratio.

## Installation
For an Onion OS formatted SD card, copy the entire **drkhrse_miyoo_bezels** folder to RetroArch\.retroarch\overlay\bezels\

All Overlays are designed for default aspect ratio (Settings > Video > Scaling > Keep Aspect Ratio set to On).

Open game and then go to the Quick Menu for Retroarch (Menu + Select buttons) > On-Screen Overlay > Overlay Preset > drkhrse_miyoo_bezels > Choose cfg file

Save your configuration afterwards in Quick Menu > Overrides at the Core, Content Directory or per Game level. More info on the setting [here](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/overrides/).

### Integer Scale Overlays

Integer scale overlays have an additional configuration step. These configuration files have "int" in the name.

Go to the Main Menu (use B button from the Quick Menu) > Settings > Video > Scaling > Integer Scale set to On and use the appropiate overlay configuration file.

**Enjoy!**
